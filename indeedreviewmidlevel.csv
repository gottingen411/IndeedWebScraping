About Syracuse University
Syracuse University is a private, international research university with distinctive academics, diversely unique offerings and an undeniable spirit. Located in the geographic heart of New York State, with a global footprint, and nearly 150 years of history, Syracuse University offers a quintessential college experience.

The scope of Syracuse University is a testament to its strengths: a pioneering history dating back to 1870; a choice of more than 200 majors and 100 minors offered through 13 schools and colleges; nearly 15,000 undergraduates and 5,000 graduate students; more than a quarter of a million alumni in 160 countries; and a student population from all 50 U.S. states and 123 countries. For more information, please visit www.syracuse.edu.


About the Syracuse area
Syracuse is a medium-sized city situated in the geographic center of New York State approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City. The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues. Syracuse and Central New York present a wide range of seasonal recreation and attractions ranging from water skiing and snow skiing, hiking in the Adirondacks, touring the historic sites, visiting wineries along the Finger Lakes, and biking on trails along the Erie Canal.

Commitment to Supporting and Hiring Veterans
Syracuse University has a long history of engaging veterans and the military-connected community through its educational programs, community outreach, and employment programs.

The University’s contemporary commitment to veterans builds on this historical legacy, and extends to both class-leading initiatives focused on making an SU degree accessible and affordable to the post-9/11 generation of veterans, and also programs designed to position Syracuse University as the employer of choice for military veterans, members of the Guard and Reserve, and military family members.

Hello, we're A Cloud Guru


Our friends call us ACG.


A Cloud Guru was built by engineers for everyone, everywhere. Here, you’ll have the freedom to follow your curiosity. We’re not afraid to just try, because when you’re working with cutting edge technologies, experimentation and trying out new ideas have to be encouraged and celebrated. Our engineers are building the world’s largest (and most awesome) cloud learning platform. Why? Our mission is to teach the world to cloud. Our fun, practical courses have helped over 1.5 million people learn to cloud, and we’re just getting started.


We’re not a training company that just decided to sell training courses. We grew up out of the cloud ecosystem. We were a bunch of cloud engineers who pulled people together to create a training platform. That’s why we’re genuinely passionate about what we create. And we are known for practicing what we preach.


What makes the Product & Technology team awesome...


Learning to the cloud means unlocking a world of possibilities for our students. Using the latest tech, we design the tools to teach people to cloud faster and better. The team is talented (and a little quirky), and we’re all in it together.



Cutting-edge tech We’ve built a cloud-first Serverless Architecture with tools like Lambda, API Gateway, GraphQL, ReactJS,


Founded by engineers Having a CEO who’s also an engineer is nice — he knows the effort it takes to make things awesome.


We don’t bite We’re friendly, down-to-earth, and collaborative. There are no high-performing jerks and no heroes. Just great teams.


Hungry and humble We’re dedicated to learning all the things to create the best product possible.





You'll do well at ACG if you're open to learning and trying new things, and you like to be surrounded by other friendly, passionate, and driven people. –Natasja, Makeup Guru (and Software Developer)


As a Data Engineer at ACG, you’ll get to:



Be an essential part of designing and building ACG’s new data platform, as we evolve the existing databases into a cutting-edge solution to meet the needs of our 2021 data plans and beyond


Explore and contribute to discussions around technologies under consideration, such as Snowflake, Kappa/Lambda architecture, Delta Lakes and Data Vault


Develop, test and maintain existing architecture, including databases, data pipelines, and large-scale processing systems


Collaborate with the Analytics team on transformation processes to populate data models


Recommend ways to improve data reliability, efficiency, and quality of the data platform and optimize for performance, scalability, and cost


Discover opportunities for data acquisition and explore new ways of using existing data


Identify gaps in data processes and drive improvements



We are looking for someone who can:



Utilize a variety of languages and tools (e.g. scripting languages) to marry systems together


Recommend ways to improve data reliability, efficiency, and quality for the whole data platform


Optimize solution designs for performance, scalability, and costs



What you bring to the table


We focus on hiring values-aligned people because we believe the right person can learn all the things to be successful in their role. Self-confidence plays a big part in what you apply for. We encourage all job applicants to apply even if they are nervous to do so. College degrees aren't required for any roles, and career gaps or switches are totally welcome.


Essential



2+ years of Data Engineering, Data Warehousing, or related experience


2+ years of development experience with Python or similar scripting language

Desirable



Knowledge of software engineering best practices with experience with implementing CI/CD, monitoring & alerting for production systems


Experience with complex data structures and No-SQL databases


Experience with open source orchestration platforms (e.g. Airflow)



We want people who care about doing a good job. The ones who have humility and hunger to learn. - Sam Kroonenburg, Co-Founder and CEO


More than a job


Where you work isn’t just a career decision - it’s a life decision. We get it. That’s why we want all of our Gurus to feel a sense of belonging that comes from feeling supported in all areas of their lives. Everyone has family, friends and interests outside of their careers, so we offer perks and benefits to make work, work better for you.



4 weeks PTO, plus 10 sick days, and holidays. Whether it's hiking to a waterfall in Costa Rica or bonding with your couch, we all need downtime. All Gurus get four weeks paid time off, 10 sick days, and enough holiday to make a banker blush.


Let's get lunch. Lunches are catered three times per week, and our kitchen stays stocked with a smorgasbord of the team’s most requested snacks and drinks.


Parking is on us. We have your Downtown parking covered. We offer paid garage parking near the office. We also have perks for going green by walking and taking public transit.


We’ve got you covered. We offer insurance plans that pay for 100% of your medical, dental, and vision and 80% for your family/dependents.


Gender-neutral paid parental leave. Expanding your family? We offer 12 weeks of gender-neutral paid parental leave and reimburse up to $10,000 for eligible adoption expenses.


$1,000 continuing education budget. All Gurus get $250 a quarter to spend on personal development and 2 hours each week reserved for learning something new.



What’s the interview process like at ACG?


Applying for a job can feel intimidating and like a full-time job of its own. You shouldn’t have to burn through a week of sick time or all your best out-of-office excuses just to put feelers out for a new career opportunity. We want to be as transparent about the process as possible to help ease your mind. It’s our goal to provide you a fair, efficient interviewing experience that respects you and your time — and to do it all with a sidecar of delight.


Once you submit an application, we’ll review it. If you’re a good fit, you’ll have an initial chat with a recruiter over the phone. A phone interview with a manager typically follows. Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). Then we’ll schedule a Zoom call to meet other members of the team, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it’s really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.


Keep being awesome, Cloud Gurus.",,

Machine Learning Engineer,10 days ago,Silverfin,,"This is probably not the first machine learning job ad you’ve seen, so we’ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we’re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don’t hesitate to apply (link at the bottom) or drop us a line with questions on engineering-recruitment@silverfin.com.

Ahum. Here it comes.
What’s a Silverfin?
At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimize their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.

The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every day more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 200.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in.
What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?
We’re a remote-first engineering team of 25 people distributed in 14 different countries. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring in this regard, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be.

Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids — whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organized that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.

Being remote-first means we favor asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in our wiki, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working!

We’d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too, as long as there’s no pandemic going around. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.

Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 7TB, and our largest table recently crossed the 10 billion row mark. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.
What does working at Silverfin look like?
You’ll take the lead in setting up the product, infrastructure and organisation to do smart things with all the data we have. Make the lives of our users easier. You’ll answer and implement questions like: Can a computer do a senior review based on historical comments? Can we generate suggestions for a tax calculation? Can bankruptcy be predicted before an accountant notices it? You might even come up with a few answerable questions yourself based on analysis of the data at hand. You will take charge of all the processes from data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing, to training models and deploying them to production.

We work in nimble teams of around 5 people in size, with each team taking ownership of a specific set of features of the application. As our first machine learning engineer, you’ll initially be a team of one, and while we expect you to be able to code most of the core parts yourself, you can rely on support from the other engineering and ops teams to integrate and deploy projects to production.
What does your future look like?
Initially you’ll work by yourself, but once things move in the right direction, we’re looking to quickly expand the team with you as the teamlead. You will be called on to help out with recruiting, managing and mentoring the other team members once that time comes.

Everyone has a €1000 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation and travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you’ll get paid like any normal day. Silverfin colleagues regularly visit conferences across the world.
What are we looking for?
You’re experienced in applying machine learning, from proof of concept to a production system. You’re able to both get your hands dirty building models, and integrating what you’ve built into a production system. While our core application is built in Ruby on Rails, it’s probably not well-suited for machine learning projects, and you can suggest a more applicable language based on the project. We’re guessing Python.
You’re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognize bikeshedding and can avoid its pitfalls.
You’re able to take initiative and push projects forward without being micromanaged.
You can code with reason and can justify the important decisions you made during development.
You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally.
You recognize and can apply engineering best practices when relevant. This includes the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but you also appreciate hygienic code, good naming, explicitness and readability over cleverness, etc. You’re willing to be flexible and pick-up other practices that the team decides on but you might not agree with.
You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project.
What can we offer you?
The opportunity to build unique projects based on a significant amount of data, on top of a solid product-oriented foundation
Actual, proper work-life balance
Choose your own working hours and work 100% remotely
Personal growth training and opportunities
The possibility to grow the team and become a teamlead
Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 25 colleagues in 14 different countries
A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues
A €1000 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills
Requirements
You have successfully taken a significant machine learning project from concept to production
At least 2 years of full-time experience with machine learning projects
Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)
Nice to have’s
These would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don’t worry if none of the following applies to you.
Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team
Experience in Fintech
Accounting knowledge

Data Scientist,9 days ago,Common Networks,"San Francisco, CA 94102 (Van Ness - Civic Center area)","Common Networks was founded on the idea that everyone should have a choice for fast, affordable access to broadband internet. Right now, most homes in the U.S. don't. In fact, 62% of homes live in a monopoly broadband market. High-speed access unlocks all the superpowers on the internet. When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn’t otherwise have.

Common Networks provides suburban neighborhoods with internet using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a few locations needing fiber access.

As our first Data Scientist, you will own our entire data pipeline, from instrumentation and extraction to analytical presentations to the executive team. Building Internet infrastructure is expensive and our business model relies on leveraging data to find as many efficiencies as possible. To that end, you’ll work with Product to find creative ways to reduce hardware costs, with Growth to squeeze every last conversion out of our onboarding funnel, with Engineering to discern network-wide ramifications of minute changes to router kernel parameters, with Coverage to sketch out the best buildings to target when we launch new markets, and with Operations to identify process breaks before they show up in our top-level metrics.

The ideal candidate is passionate about democratizing our data and eager to wear many hats - one day might entail installing Tableau and coaching stakeholders on best practices with the new BI tool, while another might involve changing our backend to emit that one metric that’s going to drastically simplify the analysis you’re trying to run. Our entire stack runs on GCP, with BigQuery as our data warehouse and all of our backend written in golang on Google’s Appengine - bonus points if you come in with experience in those technologies, but we’d also be thrilled to invest in a great candidate that hasn’t worked with those exact products.
What you do
Build and maintain dashboards for core operational metrics (e.g. network reliability, growth funnel)
Own the methodologies behind how we measure ourselves and create new metrics as the business evolves
Clean and organize our data warehouse, manage scheduled aggregations, and expose rich views of data to stakeholders
Run your own investigations into our trickiest problems, finding approachable ways to present and visualize your findings to the rest of the company
Implement simple changes to our codebase when necessary - you don’t let yourself get blocked on engineering
Chart out Common’s data roadmap, striking the right balance between quick-and-dirty analysis vs. building out robust, scalable data flows.
Requirements
BS with 5+ years of professional experience in a Data Scientist or Data Analyst role
Solid programming skills in at least one language in addition to excellent SQL skills
Experience working with and manipulating large, complex datasets.
Experience solving non-routine analysis problems, choosing the appropriate analytical methods and carrying the entire analysis from initial data gathering and requirements specification to final reporting and stakeholder presentation
Experience building, managing and organizing ETLs and data pipelinesExperience working with stakeholders to produce golden data datasets and clear views of common data needs
Excited to work in a startup environment on a small team; creative, resourceful, comfortable in a fast-moving environment. Excited to take on a wide range of responsibilities and cover many different roles loosely aligned around Data.

As a mission-driven and inclusive institution, we invite applications from candidates who share our passion and commitment to empowering women to thrive in their careers. Depending on the successful candidate's experience and professional goals, we offer several different possibilities for position title and responsibilities.

Located in Boston's historic Fenway area, Simmons has a strong tradition of empowering women and of challenging traditional gender roles and expanding opportunities for historically marginalized groups. Simmons University was one of the first higher education institutions to focus on preparing women to become leaders and has evolved to become a university offering a women-centered undergraduate program, with graduate programs open to all. MCS is a collegial and supportive community of teachers and scholars within a uniquely multidisciplinary College. Simmons faculty and staff are truly committed to our mission of preparing students to become champions of social justice and equitable leaders in their professions and their communities. This commitment and pride make for a dynamic workplace. Simmons University strives for inclusive excellence in all aspects of an individual's community experience: One of our strategic goals is to become the most inclusive campus in New England.

new",7 days ago,CollegeVine,,"Who we are
The average public high school student in the US receives 38 minutes of guidance across 4 years. Here at CollegeVine, we're working to close the guidance gap by providing free, personalized guidance to all students. We've helped thousands of students get into college since 2013, and in 2019 pivoted to an all-digital guidance offering to expand our impact. Transitioning from one-on-one guidance to a 100% software offering is a big challenge, but we've been able to meet it thanks to our unique culture.
You'll be joining a distributed, talented team that's deeply invested in the problems we're trying to solve. We live all around the world, working from our homes, coffee shops, and even a boat! We recruit and hire from varied backgrounds based on our belief that our team's diversity allows us to create better solutions for families.
Who we're looking for
You know you're right for this position if:
You seek ownership beyond your own work, and look to the product and company as a whole.
You are a self-starter and internally motivated, with a strong desire to be part of a successful team that shares your high standards.
You understand what it means to be entrepreneurial and resourceful. Perhaps you've launched your own side-project, worked at a startup, or helped a scrappy business grow quickly.
Qualifications
In addition to your awesome attitude and values, we're looking for someone with the following skills:
Expertise with statistical software (i.e. R, Python, Julia, Matlab) and databases (SQL)
You're comfortable with git
At least a year's experience A/B testing
Excellent communication skills
It's an added bonus if you have:
An interest or curiosity around typed functional programming (we use Haskell & Purescript extensively)
Prior experience working with Rails, Django, or another MVC web framework
Worked remotely before
Gone through the US college admissions process, or can articulate how it works
About the Role
You'll be assuming ownership for our core algorithms and models. This means not only are you responsible for maintaining them, but we also expect you to propose radical improvements and suggest new areas for us to apply data science.
You'll be responsible for maintaining your own roadmap, with input from our product teams. But the roadmap is ultimately yours.
Your first week
You'll be given a crash course in how college admissions works. You'll meet the team and start working on one of the projects in our backlog. Finally, you'll start learning how our website works.
Your first month
You'll continue working through the project backlog. We also expect you'll be soaking up admissions knowledge, which means you'll start suggesting some project ideas of your own. We'll also make sure you've begun building relationships with our PMs.
Three months in
By this point you should be starting to shape your own roadmap and executing against it.
Six months in
A lot can happen in six months. During your first six months you've leveled up our core algorithms and have started exploring new ways data science can help CollegeVine's families and partners.
Benefits
We offer a competitive salary and a full suite of benefits, some of them unconventional, but awesome for the right person:
Medical, dental, vision insurance, and a 401k.
Flexible workday with a 4-hour core centered on EST - plan the rest of your workday as you wish, just give us the majority of your most creative hours.
Goal-based environment (as opposed to grind-based or decree-based environment; work smarter, not harder; intelligently, not mindlessly). We collaborate on setting goals, but you set your own process for accomplishing those goals. You will be entrusted with a lot of responsibility and you might even experience fulfillment and self-actualization as a result.
Join an engineering culture that celebrates mindfulness and takes the quality of your attention seriously.
Remember: We’re a startup. You’re an early employee. We face challenges. We have to ship (a lot). Your ideas matter. You will make a difference.
This is a Telecommute/Work from Home position.

More than a job
Where you work isn’t just a career decision - it’s a life decision. We get it. That’s why we want all of our Gurus to feel a sense of belonging that comes from feeling supported in all areas of their lives. Everyone has family, friends and interests outside of their careers, so we offer perks and benefits to make work, work better for you.
4 weeks PTO, plus 10 sick days, and holidays. Whether it's hiking to a waterfall in Costa Rica or bonding with your couch, we all need downtime. All Gurus get four weeks paid time off, 10 sick days, and enough holiday to make a banker blush.
Let's get lunch. Lunches are catered three times per week, and our kitchen stays stocked with a smorgasbord of the team’s most requested snacks and drinks.
Parking is on us. We have your Downtown parking covered. We offer paid garage parking nearby the office. We also have perks for going green by walking and taking public transit.

What’s the interview process like at ACG?
Applying for a job can feel intimidating and like a full-time job of its own. You shouldn’t have to burn through a week of sick time or all your best out-of-office excuses just to put feelers out for a new career opportunity. We want to be as transparent about the process as possible to help ease your mind. It’s our goal to provide you a fair, efficient interviewing experience that respects you and your time — and to do it all with a sidecar of delight.
Once you submit an application, we’ll review it. If you’re a good fit, you’ll have an initial chat with a recruiter over the phone. A phone interview with a manager typically follows. Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). Then we’ll schedule a Zoom call to meet other members of the team, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it’s really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.
