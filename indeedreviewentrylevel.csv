Core Competencies




Safety
Makes sure to understand every safety practice expected by the organization. Takes no shortcuts that increase the risks of accidents, personal injuries or equipment failures. Looks for unsafe practices in the workplace and takes responsibility to ensure that others are aware of the potential impact. This is distinctly different from those who are unaware of many safety expectations, take shortcuts that increase safety risks, and/or fail to recognize and take timely action to increase safe practices by others.


Quality of Work
Has established a track record of producing work that is highly accurate, demonstrates attention to detail and reflects well on the organization. Is personally committed to high quality work and encourages others to have similar standards. This differs from those who cannot be relied upon to produce high quality work, pay little attention to detail, show little pride in a job well done and/or set a poor example for co-workers or direct reports.


Teamwork
Is an effective team player who adds complementary skills and contributes valuable ideas, opinions and feedback. Communicates in an open and candid manner and can be counted upon to fulfill any commitments made to others on the team. This is distinctly different from those who withhold ideas and opinions, offer ideas or opinions that rarely add value to team discussions, have established a track record with many unmet commitments, and/or have not contributed skills that complement the skills of others on the team.


Continuous Improvement
Finds it unacceptable when patient and customer outcomes could be improved. Takes personal responsibility for maintaining and upgrading own knowledge, skills and abilities to ensure that service delivery is safe, efficient and effective. Strives to stay abreast of new approaches to healthcare. Demonstrates full commitment to quality improvement initiatives by taking an active role, being a positive model and by encouraging others to be equally committed and accountable. Is proactive in calling attention to service delivery deficiencies or opportunities and offers concrete suggestions for improving processes and systems that affect quality of care and productivity.


Education and Self Development
Makes it a practice to take charge of self-development by soliciting feedback, setting priorities, and then acquiring or strengthening skills and knowledge through coursework or other methods. This is in distinct contrast to those who avoid, discount or ignore feedback, fail to identify self-improvement needs or resist learning opportunities as unnecessary or untimely.





Commitment to Accountabilities



At Flagler Hospital, certain values shape and influence all of our decisions and actions. These accountabilities are demonstrated through adherence to our core competencies and represented each day in our commitment to patients and their families, visitors, and our team members.

Job Title
Instructor, Business Analytics/Data Science, Economics

Department
Economics

Essential Functions
The College of Business Administration at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO), an AACSB accredited institution, is located in the heart of Omaha, Nebraska, a metropolitan area with an MSA population of approximately 942,198. Omaha is home to ten Fortune 1000 firms and has a strong business environment. UNO offers about 200 programs of study to approximately 15,575 students. Despite its size, small classes are the norm. Additional information about UNO can be found at https://www.unomaha.edu.
The Department of Economics at the University of Nebraska at Omaha invites applications for an instructor in the area of business analytics and data science. While this is an instructor position, salary will be commensurate with the skills necessary for this highly technical teaching position.
The College of Business Administration (CBA) offers several high-demand data science programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels with concentrations in Econometrics and Data Analytics as well as Business Analytics. This position will play a key role in growing and expanding the program through teaching and curriculum development activities. We recommend the candidate familiarize themselves with the following program pages:
1. https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-business-administration/economics/graduate-programs/concentrations/concentration-econometrics.php
2. https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-business-administration/mba/program/data-analytics.php
3. https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-business-administration/economics/undergraduate-program/business-analytics.php
A top candidate is expected to be a teaching specialist with a strong passion for teaching Business/Data Analytics courses. The successful candidate will likely teach courses such as master’s level econometrics, advanced econometric classes with some machine learning content, business reporting classes (e.g. Power BI, Tableau, Google Data Studio), SQL and database/data storage class, quantitative/statistics courses, and, when the need arises, large principles-level classes. Given the nature of these courses, a deep understanding of data storage and programming techniques is highly valued. However, the Department of Economics prefers a candidate who is a passionate instructor with fluency in some of the listed skills (and interest in future mastery of the listed languages and software) over a candidate who has mastered all of the languages and software but is less enthusiastic about providing excellent instruction at the graduate and undergraduate levels.
UNO is strongly integrated with local employers, forming partnerships with local organizations to enhance the students’ learning experience is expected. In particular, we expect that some classes taught by the instructor will be integrated with partners in the Department of Homeland Security as part of a grant recently awarded to our college through the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education Center of Excellence (NCITE). Other local partnerships (as well as other innovative teaching techniques) are encouraged, and UNO strives to “grow with and within our thriving community.”
CBA’s Department of Economics has a strong culture of teaching. The department houses the UNO Center for Economic Education, the production office of the Journal of Economics Teaching, and multiple faculty members who research education or learning. Additionally, the successful candidate will join an existing team of data scientists with a strong commitment to teaching quality and student success. The successful candidate should want to join this community of teachers and be equally committed to student success.
To apply, go to https://unomaha.peopleadmin.com/. Cover letters, curriculum vitae or resume, and evidence of teaching effectiveness (e.g., teaching innovations designed by the applicant, involvement in programs related to instructional excellence), and a statement of teaching philosophy addressing the candidate’s ability to foster an inclusive learning environment for a community of diverse learners. Letters of reference will be requested from finalists for the position at a later date.
Review of applications will begin October 1, 2020. The position is open until filled but only applications received by October 1, 2020 can be assured full consideration. We will continue to accept applications until the position is filled. An ideal candidate would be available to begin work in January, 2021, but could be delayed to August, 2021 if needed. For general employment information, go to https://www.unomaha.edu/humanresources/.
The university and department have a strong commitment to achieving diversity among faculty and staff. The University of Nebraska does not discriminate based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, marital status, and/or political affiliation in its programs, activities, or employment. UNO is a VEVRAA Federal Contractor and an E-Verify employer.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can't put us in a box.
But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

"Junior/Returning Data Engineer
new",4 days ago,Princeton University,"Princeton, NJ 08542","Princeton Gerrymandering Project -- Junior/Returning Data Engineer
Apply Here: https://tinyurl.com/data-engineer-job-application
As the entire US redraws every state and congressional district over the next two years, the Princeton Gerrymandering Project will support fair and transparent redistricting during this critical juncture in American democracy. We have pioneered new methods for data collection, map analysis, legal briefs, and redistricting legislation to help reformers in all 50 states.
We are focusing on 10-15 priority states in the next 2 years where redistricting reform needs critical support, or where litigation is likely and rigorous analysis necessary. PGP solves four issues that are key to reform:
1. Give data to people who need it: In many states, granular geographic election data is difficult to acquire or use to draw or analyze maps. We are building datasets and resources that allow anyone to access this data before redistricting in 2020 and 2021.
2. Use technology to empower citizens during redistricting: Political parties often have access to advanced data and technology that enables them to draw maps with unforeseen effects. We work with experts and developers to create open source software and applications to empower citizens. We are closely involved in this community and are working to lead the dissemination and training of citizens in our priority states.
3. Rapid response during the 2021 redistricting process. Redistricting will kick into high gear in 2021 after Census data becomes available. We will go through a period of high-intensity work requiring the rapid analysis of draft plans, construction of demonstration maps, and coordination with press organizations and citizen groups in a dozen key states.
4. Assist formation of local reform networks within states: Some states, like Virginia and Michigan, have a strong anti-gerrymandering advocacy coalitions. Many states lack interdisciplinary efforts to monitor political map drawing. In Virginia and Michigan, our data and analysis has been critical to reform. We plan to give tools to local actors in these states so that they have capacities similar to ours.
About the team: PGP is a six person cross-functional and interdisciplinary team housed at Princeton University. This team currently produces reports, prepares data, performs analysis, and publishes state-specific legal and mathematical analysis wherever redistricting is happening.
Examples include:
Virginia House of Delegates map analysis to enhance racial fairness.
Columns by Sam Wang and his team on the way forward: N_ YT_ (Nov 2018, July 2019), Richmond T_imes-Dispatch, Raleigh News and Observer_.
OpenPrecincts.org, a data resource to power redistricting analytics in all 50 states.
Published scholarship to support measures of fairness ( Election Law Journal) and theories for litigation ( U. Penn. J. Const. Law) .
In New Jersey, sponsored legislation for data transparency, passed into law in 2019, and worked to prevent unfair practices.
Analyses of best practices for reform in Michigan, Virginia, and New Jersey.
What PGP has for you:
We’re a small team doing big things. We’re looking for a new or returning technical mind to join our team as a Data Technician to help us build tools to fight gerrymandering. This is a full-time position on a one-year renewable contract. The yearly salary range for this position is $65,000 -

Using real-time connected data, machine learning, and automation; the team enables Cisco sellers and partners to deliver a powerful, personalized experience—throughout the entire customer lifecycle. DLJ is focused on providing customers with an immersive digital experience with Cisco. This in turn drives improvements in recurring revenue, cost savings and sales effectiveness for Cisco and its partners.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",4.1,"5,766 reviews"

Data Engineer,10 days ago,The Bail Project,"Marina del Rey, CA 90292","About The Bail Project:
The Problem
There is no place in the criminal justice system where money more clearly buys justice than bail. People who can’t afford bail remain in jail before trial, while those with money buy their liberty. Tying freedom to financial ability upends the presumption of innocence, tears lives apart, and perpetuates racial and economic disparities. It is also a key driver of mass incarceration. Each year, an estimated 2.5 million people sit in jail cells across America because they cannot afford bail.
The Response
The Bail Project is a national nonprofit that provides free bail assistance and pretrial support to thousands of low-income people every year. We’re on a mission to combat mass incarceration and demonstrate that a more humane, equitable, and effective pretrial system is possible.
The Model
The Bail Project uses a national revolving bail fund to pay bail for individuals who are legally presumed innocent, and whom a judge has deemed eligible for release. We then provide court reminders and work with local partner organizations to connect our clients with voluntary social services and community-based programs. We call this model Community Release with Support, and it has proven highly effective in helping people make their court dates. As our clients’ cases close, bail comes back into the fund where it is recycled to help additional people. In addition to these direct services, The Bail Project gathers human stories and data from our sites to support grassroots advocacy and inform policy recommendations.
The Team
We’re a community of advocates committed to ending mass incarceration and advancing racial and economic justice. Our organization consists of a central support team and a growing network of client advocates or “Bail Disruptors” who work in their local communities to provide bail assistance and lead our advocacy efforts on the ground. This position will be a part of our growing Data Team and will report directly to the Data and Product Development Manager.The department is part of the central support team in Los Angeles but it currently operates remotely so there is some flexibility around location.
Summary:
The Data Engineer plays a key role in supporting The Bail Project’s mission to end cash bail. Working as part of the Data Team, the Data Engineer will develop and maintain critical data pipelines to support operations and inform research and advocacy. This individual will contribute to building a new data warehouse and work alongside data team members to document data specifications. The Data Engineer will demonstrate meticulous attention to detail to build an incontrovertible data platform that informs The Bail Project’s mission to promote a more just and equitable pretrial system.
Qualifications:
You are driven, highly organized, and have a deep commitment to The Bail Project’s mission to eliminate race and wealth-based disparities in our criminal justice system. Applicants must be willing to work independently as well as in collaborative teams. A sense of humor, innovative spirit, and willingness to adapt to the change inherent to a rapidly scaling start-up are essential.
Key Responsibilities:
Support with the development of data modeling strategy and design standards
Develop data pipelines to extract, transform, clean, and audit data from external systems into a cloud-based data warehouse
Monitor Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) jobs and troubleshoot operational or data issues in the data pipelines
Document analytical workflows and contribute to data dictionary
Prepare complex database queries to support research and advocacy initiatives
To excel in this role, you likely bring the following:
Excellent attention to detail and high concern for data quality
Commitment to working toward common goals in a small team setting
Proficiency with Python or similar programming languages
Proficiency with database query languages (e.g., SQL)
Demonstrated experience with ETL (Extraction, Transformation & Loading)
Familiarity with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS)
How to Apply:
Interested applicants should submit a resume and cover letter. In the cover letter, please address the following:
Why do you want to work for The Bail Project?
Share an example of a time when you learned a new technology to solve a data engineering problem
No faxes or phone calls please. Applicants will be notified regarding whether or not they have been selected for an interview. Applications without cover letters will not be processed.

Willingness to travel up to 50% (will likely travel 20-40%) (after current McKinsey travel restrictions due to COVID-19 are lifted; all work is currently remote)

WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH
You’ll work with McKinsey’s Climate Analytics team, ideally co-located with our team in Denver or Brussel.
Our Climate Analytics team is McKinsey’s core team of experts who analyze, and generate insights from, the quantitative impact of climate change for our clients.
McKinsey’s Climate Analytics team is a small, close-knit team of ~8 within a broader team called ACRE. ACRE is composed of ~40 data scientists, engineers and expert consultants dedicated to conducting advanced analytics for food and agriculture clients. Although our Climate Analytics team is officially part of ACRE, and many of your core clients served will be agriculture clients because of this, our Climate Analytics team works across all sectors at McKinsey being impacted by climate change—for example, the public, energy, and financial sectors. Regardless of the sectors in which you work, you will get the opportunity to work with multi-disciplinary teams with digital, analytics, research and business backgrounds.
ACRE—and through extension, our Climate Analytics team—is an agile team within the firm whose goal is to use the latest analytical methods, incubate new technologies and drive innovative ways to develop new opportunities for the firm to make significant and lasting client impact – redefining what it means to provide the “best of the firm” to our clients.
WHAT YOU'LL DO
You will leverage deep knowledge of climate and earth systems as well as analytical expertise to provide insights to clients (as part of a client service team), within ACRE by strengthening our core client product offerings, and across McKinsey and the public by synthesizing and disseminating climate-related insights via internally and externally published articles and visualizations.
Approximately half of your time will be spent solving specific business problems on client projects (either remotely or on site) and the other half of your time spent developing new, or improving upon existing, products for the Climate Analytics team within ACRE.
As a member of a client service team, you will leverage your creativity and problem-solving skills to design solutions to core business problems that best meet client needs and communicate the outcomes and insights of your work to primarily non-technical executive audiences. Some of the issues we are tasked with on a client project include: retrieving and processing large amounts of data from cloud storage, conducting analyses and generating insight based on medium to long term projected changes in climate, and more generally utilizing climate domain expertise to provide climate-specific insight and inform strategy for addressing climate risk across industries.
When working internally with the ACRE team, you will improve current product offerings (what we call “IP development”) to best meet our most common client needs. You will work in a collaborative agile team environment where you will bring together a variety of global data sources, implement different algorithms and utilize cutting edge methodologies and approaches to develop proprietary solutions. You will work together with our data engineering team to design and deploy applications and dashboards to deliver faster, more impactful insights to our clients.
Along the way, you will learn how to structure business problems and serve as a client advisor while working closely with other data scientists/engineers and senior leaders across industries shaping the future of climate. You will have access to unparalleled career acceleration, with ownership and responsibility to lead the work you do from day one in a collaborative, diverse, non-hierarchical environment. You will have the opportunity to travel to client sites, locally and around the world. Lastly, you will be able to provide direct and measurable impact to some of the largest players from energy to agriculture around the globe.",4.3,560 reviews

Where the Chemistry Happens…
BASF's Data Science Professional Development Program (PDP) is created to provide highly motivated, mobile-minded current university students an opportunity to enhance their professional skills through a variety of diverse learning experiences.

"Software Engineer, Customer Data Applications Team",11 days ago,Square,"San Francisco, CA 94103 (South of Market area)","Company Description

Square builds common business tools in unconventional ways so more people can start, run, and grow their businesses. When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We’re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we’re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.

Job Description
If you think about the story of Square, it's largely a story of a payments company that spawned an ecosystem of products related to commerce: Payroll, Capital, Appointments, Employee Management, Loyalty, Gift Cards and many more. People come to Square for payments, but they stay for the integrated ecosystem.
The Customer Data Applications team is at the center of all this and is one of the two teams working on a data integration platform that connects this ecosystem of products to our payments customers. We started our journey by powering marketing use cases and built a customer data platform instead of simply integrating with 3rd party marketing tools. Now that the system is up and running, we're starting to build and integrate a new ecosystem of products powered by data, including personalization and ML, analytics, segmentation, data governance, and warehousing just to name a few.
Furthermore, the team is unique in that we build most of our services on the Google Cloud platform therefore there are opportunities to become an expert in cloud tooling which is a valuable set of skills to have as the world moves towards the cloud.
As a member of our team, you will:
Work with product and design to build first party applications on the platform to enable a variety of use cases such as personalization, self-servability, etc.
Help us architect the core Square wide data models that unify data from a number of distributed services.
Design and build APIs and highly available services that deliver personalized, real-time content.
Work with all product teams across Square to enable or build data integrations and client logging libraries.
Work closely with our data science and analytics teams to build event-based triggers for intelligent decisioning.
Build data pipelines and integrations that connect Squares services to cloud services and 3rd party tools.
Work with the Marketing Operations team to either build or integrate tools to make marketing more automated and effective.

Qualifications
You have:
Demonstrated excellence in Python, Java or Ruby
A desire to be directly responsible for the lifecycle of engineering solutions. This includes leading the design and implementation of projects and organizing the team to achieve a remarkable solution.
Experience designing and building APIs
A love of data, data munging and care about building the right abstractions
A strong desire to see your work have direct impact on the business
Preferred Qualifications:
Experience with Google Cloud Platform
Expertise with streaming technologies (Kafka, Pubsub, Kinesis) and log-based architectures and experience writing batch and stream processing jobs (i.e. Apache Beam, Google Cloud DataFlow, Apache Spark, Apache Storm)

"Postdoc in Machine Learning, computational biology, and geno...",11 days ago,USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS),"Gainesville, FL 32608","This is a postdoc position to develop new Salmonella typing and phenotype prediction methods from genomes and metagenomes using population genomics and machine learning. The project is novel in a number of ways. We will be using graph representations to identify polymorphisms in ~250,000 genomes then use that information to train disentangled variational autoencoders to create reduced representations of genome space and synthetic data for training neural networks for phenotype prediction and antimicrobial resistance. The same data will be used for active learning to train models for sanitizer resistance. Because of the genome size and the number of genomes, Salmonella is a great system to develop new non-linear polygenic scoring models that could have a major impact on other areas of genomics. Salmonellosis is also a serious disease that sickens 1 million Americans a year and causes billions in economic losses. Improving methods of detection will help to reduce outbreaks.

We partner with the best retail stores in over 1200 cities across North America to serve up the best buying experience. Drizly offers a huge selection and competitive pricing with a side of personalized content. That is what we do. Who we are is a different story.

We are more than just another tech company. There is an intellectual curiosity that occurs at Drizly. We have a desire to question, to understand, to figure it out. Bottom line, we solve it. We value not just the truth but the process to get to the truth, to deliberate, decide and then act. Most importantly, we care. We care about our customer. We care about our company. We care about our team. There will be long days and incredible challenges.

We are blazing a trail in an industry that hasn’t changed in nearly a century, and that doesn’t scare us (well, not all the time) -and even when it does, it doesn’t stop us, it energizes us.

Machine Learning Engineer,23 days ago,Triplebyte,,"Role Description
Triplebyte screens and evaluates thousands of engineers per month to find the best candidates for our partner companies. Human decision making doesn't work at our scale; our marketplace is powered by automated assessment and decision making. Triplebyte has three cornerstone ML products: our quiz, our interview, and our matchmaking. As a machine learning engineer, you'll be responsible for the end-to-end process of designing and running experiments to serving production models at scale. Some of our pipelines use off the shelf components, but we're also implementing custom models and techniques from the latest research papers. We're also building forecasting tools for internal teams to measure and predict outcomes. This is an ideal role for an engineer or data scientist who wants the scope and responsibility to own features/products from the inception and research phase through to measuring real-world results.
Fields your work will touch on
Psychometrics
Recommender systems
Time series analysis
Survival analysis
Bayesian inference
Probabilistic programming
Requirements
Robust exploratory/experimental skills. We have a novel dataset of candidate profiles and interview outcomes from our candidate screening process and our hiring marketplace. You'll be responsible for designing and evaluating experiments to predict downstream outcomes.
Ability to implement models from research. Some of our best improvements in both speed and predictiveness has come from doing literature surveys and implementing novel techniques from research papers.
Engineering skills. This is a hybrid research/engineering role. You'll be responsible for productionizing your pipelines/models and integrating against our back-end services.
About Triplebyte
Triplebyte is a hiring marketplace used by companies like Apple, Dropbox, Stripe, and Instacart to hire the best technical talent. We are on a mission to build a meritocratic hiring process, and we do all our evaluation background blind. Our ultimate goal is to collect the largest dataset and use this to build the world's best technical hiring process. No other company has successfully done what we're doing in this field.
We are growing extremely quickly, working on a problem that is fundamental, sitting at the crossroads between the workforce and employers. Ten years from now, it'll look silly to use anything other than Triplebyte for technical hiring.
Company Culture
We have a laid-back, friendly office culture. Over lunch you'll often find us discussing the latest in technology, books, and pop culture, and then maybe getting in a quick game of chess or babyfoot (foosball).
Since we're an early-stage company, we move fast, and it's important that each member of our team is able to take ownership of projects by defining problems, brainstorming solutions, and running experiments.

Who we are:
Distributors power the world's economy. They sustain the supply chains that deliver nearly every physical product you come across. But, distributors could be way more efficient. We believe that we can invigorate the $6 Trillion dollar distribution industry by empowering the people who sell these products with AI insights, and change the way the world moves around us.
This isn't an interesting problem just because of its scope. If you're a deeply curious person you'll thrive on the details of this problem. Distributors have thousands of products and customers, and many millions of orders annually. Right now, the data on these orders is largely unused, making it impossible for distributors to predict customer needs and make proactive changes. But where others see invoices, we see intellectual problems.
What the job is:
We're looking for a data integration engineer to build our team and make that vision a reality. In this role, you'll build tools that allow us to pull and ingest data from our clients, and build larger scalable systems to make that faster and easier. You'll collaborate with the rest of our integrations team to field client requests for customization of their deployments. This position reports to our head integrations engineer.
We're growing quickly, so excellent organizational skills are a must. You'll have the chance to really shape how we do integrations technically, as well as helping to define the values and processes that guide our integrations process.
Our integrations work is done principally in Python with a growing set of components written in Go. Experience with software development is essential, but immediate familiarity with those languages is not necessary. We use a micro service architecture and care more about efficacy than dogma: if there's a compelling reason to write something in Clojure, we'll do it.
Values that matter to us:
Independent: You take ownership of your own work, and thrive when given creative freedom. You like to experiment with new concepts, and don't mind making mistakes, so long as you learn from them.
Cooperative: You love helping teammates work towards the common goal. You know that no one has all the answers, and are comfortable supporting teammates who are outside of their domain and having them do the same for you.
Agile: Things move quickly when you're growing as quickly as we are. You're able to adapt to new and interesting challenges that you face every day, even when they're different from the ones you faced yesterday.
Applications are reviewed weekly. Applications submitted by approximately noon on Fridays should receive a reply by the following Friday.

Machine Learning Engineer,23 days ago,Triplebyte,,"Role Description
Triplebyte screens and evaluates thousands of engineers per month to find the best candidates for our partner companies. Human decision making doesn't work at our scale; our marketplace is powered by automated assessment and decision making. Triplebyte has three cornerstone ML products: our quiz, our interview, and our matchmaking. As a machine learning engineer, you'll be responsible for the end-to-end process of designing and running experiments to serving production models at scale. Some of our pipelines use off the shelf components, but we're also implementing custom models and techniques from the latest research papers. We're also building forecasting tools for internal teams to measure and predict outcomes. This is an ideal role for an engineer or data scientist who wants the scope and responsibility to own features/products from the inception and research phase through to measuring real-world results.
Fields your work will touch on
Psychometrics
Recommender systems
Time series analysis
Survival analysis
Bayesian inference
Probabilistic programming
Requirements
Robust exploratory/experimental skills. We have a novel dataset of candidate profiles and interview outcomes from our candidate screening process and our hiring marketplace. You'll be responsible for designing and evaluating experiments to predict downstream outcomes.
Ability to implement models from research. Some of our best improvements in both speed and predictiveness has come from doing literature surveys and implementing novel techniques from research papers.
Engineering skills. This is a hybrid research/engineering role. You'll be responsible for productionizing your pipelines/models and integrating against our back-end services.
About Triplebyte
Triplebyte is a hiring marketplace used by companies like Apple, Dropbox, Stripe, and Instacart to hire the best technical talent. We are on a mission to build a meritocratic hiring process, and we do all our evaluation background blind. Our ultimate goal is to collect the largest dataset and use this to build the world's best technical hiring process. No other company has successfully done what we're doing in this field.
We are growing extremely quickly, working on a problem that is fundamental, sitting at the crossroads between the workforce and employers. Ten years from now, it'll look silly to use anything other than Triplebyte for technical hiring.
Company Culture
We have a laid-back, friendly office culture. Over lunch you'll often find us discussing the latest in technology, books, and pop culture, and then maybe getting in a quick game of chess or babyfoot (foosball).
Since we're an early-stage company, we move fast, and it's important that each member of our team is able to take ownership of projects by defining problems, brainstorming solutions, and running experiments.

Jacaranda Health is a non-profit organization that believes every woman and her family should experience childbirth safely and with dignity. Founded in 2011, we work with governments to improve the quality of care in the public sector, where the majority of under-served women deliver babies. In a short period of time, Jacaranda has deployed innovative, low-cost tools and processes that are dramatically changing the status quo in government hospitals. From 3 hospital partners in 2015, we now work with 100+ hospitals across 5 Kenyan counties. Our digital health platform has enrolled 150,000+ pregnant women and new mothers, while our provider training programs reach 1500+ providers every quarter. We have an ambitious scaling strategy for catalyzing change across the country and the region.

Our technology and analytics team is building new tools and systems that form the engine of this scaling strategy. Here are some examples of how this approach is having a direct impact on the lives of mothers and babies in Kenya: Teletriaging During COVID-19, Data for decision-making, Tech for nurse coaching, Using AI to help mothers get the care they need.

We are looking for a mid-career data scientist who is excited about using her skills to make a difference in the lives of mothers and babies across Kenya. The Data Science Fellow will be instrumental in building out Jacaranda’s data science practice by collaborating with our technology, research design and program teams to define the right questions to ask and deploy best practice tools to measure our impact. The Fellow will also take the lead in compiling and sharing these insights with local and global stakeholders.
Location: This role can be a remote position, but we are looking for a candidate who is comfortable with working during part of the East Africa Timezone workday.

About You:

You’re a mid-career data scientist looking to give back with your quantitative skills. You’ve proven your skills on a broad range of data science projects that span the entire project lifecycle - from early conceptualization to solution delivery. At a career inflection point, you’re looking to build a body of work that can result in immediate social impact, but also be relevant for a broad range of experts in the fields of health, machine learning and data science.
You’re a leader, anxious to take the reins on high-profile projects. You are excited by the opportunity to extract insights from Jacaranda’s work and to translate them into actionable solutions for our program teams. This approach would have a short-term impact on the lives of mothers and babies in Kenya, but would also be shared with implementers in other countries. One of your favorite parts of this job is all the people you will meet, from non-profit directors to government officials, and understanding their needs.

You’re a self-directed data geek that is energized by communicating your highly technical work with those unversed in the trade. Your supervisor fills more of a role of thought partner than task doler. Beneficiaries of your efforts see you as an empathetic communicator. You love working with teams to build individual and collective capacity. Chances are, you’ll be challenged more by the state of data science (and data quality) than by the quantitative techniques you employ. You can understand the language of non-profits and translate it into technical requirements , and vice versa. You can explain bayesian statistics to NGOs and make them care about it.

What You’ll Do:
Work closely with the Executive Director to build Jacaranda’s nascent Data Science practice – including defining what the purpose, strategy and performance indicators of that practice should be
Design and deploy the appropriate analytical approaches that extracts insights from Jacaranda’s client, provider and facility-oriented programs
Work with Jacaranda’s RD team to help ask and answers interesting questions that will improve program impact
Integrate analytical tools into our data architecture, dashboards and program management tools
Communicate learnings with a broad range of stakeholders (government, academics, funders) in a variety of formats (case studies, journal articles, presentations).

Requirements:
You’re someone who knows their way around the “data stack” - R, Python, MySQL and their brethren. You can get the data you need wherever it lives, organize it, and explore it, i.e. ETL and data wrangling, particularly with less-than-ideal datasets
You know your machine learning - pattern recognition and predictive modeling
Extremely organized. Whether or not you are a type A in your personal life, you certainly are in your work life. You don’t let any details get lost and you make the container store look disorganized.
Highly adaptable. You can work any project, with any team. Not because you know everything, because you love working on teams and you are the one who always puts it on themselves to see their team succeed.
A part of the whole. You care more about just getting your projects complete. Continuous improvements is a mantra of yours. You will always be contributing learnings to the team so we can make constant updates to our process and our product.
English language skills are essential.

Bonus qualifications:
Non-profit / NGO experience working in a limited resource setting
Experience managing data science projects across teams
Advanced degree in applied statistics, mathematics, computer science, or other quantitative area is a strong plus.",,

General Description
CUNY Fellowship in the Behavioral Sciences
The City University of New York (CUNY) - Office of Institutional Research and Assessment (OIRA) announces a one-year fellowship in the behavioral sciences. Behavioral science is the study of how people make decisions and act within a complex world where details and context matter. It draws from decades of research in the social sciences to create a more realistic framework for understanding the way people form intentions and take actions.

Behavioral science has been used across a variety of fields to realign policies, programs, and products with how we really behave, improving outcomes for millions of people worldwide. OIRA is testing the use of lessons from the behavioral sciences at CUNY through a project called the Student Persistence Initiative (SPI), which is funded by the Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity.

CUNY is the nation's leading urban public university serving more than 275,000 students in 25 colleges and institutions in New York City. CUNY-OIRA conducts research and provides data to improve student success and acts as an incubator for new interventions, providing rigorous evidence to identify the most effective, and taking the best to scale at CUNY. SPI is one of these projects.

Under the supervision of the Director for Institutional Research, the fellow will provide quantitative analytic support and data for the implementation and scaling of a set of behavioral interventions over the course of academic year 2020-21. The fellow will work in collaboration with partner CUNY schools and the SPI Project Manager to develop and implement projects that address barriers to student engagement, retention, and success. Planned projects include scaling multi-year interventions through Blackboard, emails, and text messages.

Responsibilities may include but are not limited to:
Conduct student data extraction and analysis (including, but not limited to, academic records, enrollment data, Blackboard analytics, and student experience survey results)

"Senior Software Engineer, Data Infrastructure Fault Toleranc...",30+ days ago,HubSpot,Massachusetts,"About the team
The HubSpot Product team is made up of over 700 engineers, designers, product managers, and researchers. We're passionate about building tools that help small and medium-sized businesses market, sell, and serve their customers — and ultimately, grow better.
The product team is supported by many Infrastructure teams including the Data Infrastructure group.
The Data Infrastructure group provides datastores as a service for HubSpot Engineering. This involves building and maintaining the automation that manages data storage technologies, making it dead simple for development teams to leverage existing datastores, and working to ensure HubSpot can meet the demands of a business that is scaling rapidly. Data Infrastructure teams work with a variety of open source technologies such as MySQL, Vitess, Hadoop, HBase, Kafka, Spark, Memcached, and Elasticsearch all running on AWS and Kubernetes.
The HubSpot product has more than a half a million weekly active users who all generate massive traffic to and from our datastores. On a normal day we expect reads into our HBase clusters to exceed 45 million requests/sec. For MySql, we expect more than 600K queries/sec. Elasticsearch indexes over 200K doc/sec and handles more than 50K searches/sec. Finally HubSpot uses Kafka to process more than 100 billion messages a day.
Due to the extreme scale at which we operate, we often uncover bugs and errors in the open source tools we use and as such we are active members of the open source community. Many members of our teams are frequent contributors to the Open Source projects that they work on.
What we're looking for
The mission of the Fault Tolerance team is to improve the uptime and throughput product, reduce the mean time to recovery whenever we have an outage, and build systems that will make our infrastructure more resilient. This team works closely with the data store teams as well as the product teams to remediate known issues and identity and fix future places where the product could go down.
We're looking for experienced engineers who are excited by the challenges that come from working at scale and understand that reliability and uptime are critical features. We favor forward thinking engineers who can identify and remediate problems before they happen, and understand how to build platforms that are intuitive to use, highly performant, and extremely reliable.
Bonus points for:
Being someone who wakes up every morning and asks, are my systems going to be reliable today? Someone with experience developing automation or is a power user of one or more of the above-mentioned data storage technologies.
Having a bias for fixing problems with technology rather than process

Machine Learning Engineer,30+ days ago,Synapse Financial Technologies Inc,"San Francisco, CA 94105 (Yerba Buena area)","We are looking for machine learning engineers to help us build an automated backoffice. In traditional banks, back offices are filled with humans. Their job usually is to verify physical documents (like government issued IDs, proof of address, proof of income documents etc), fill out forms, and search for people on google (no joke) and other sites.
Instead of using people, we want to use machines to do these things. Here is our reasoning behind this: If we can automate the back office, then we won't have costs associated with customers like traditional banks. We would be able to offer state of the art finance products to everyone at a low cost, regardless of their bank balance. (Usually banks charge monthly management fees to people with lower bank balance, aka people with lower socioeconomic status - we want to break that cycle).
Check this out: https://medium.com/synapsefi/insto-instant-account-opening-a2aac88bc0dd. Everything here uses machine learning, from instant government ID verification, to video authentication to social media verification. These are the kind of tools you will be building.
In order to be successful at Synapse, you should have:
An ability to work independently within a small, fast-paced team
An entrepreneurial spirit and unrelenting passion to deliver the best service possible
The ability to implement feedback, learn quickly, and contribute new ideas
A general concern for the wellbeing of others and the desire to work on problems that maximize a positive future for humanity
Key Qualifications:
Experience with Python, with strong love for writing tests
Experience with Tensorflow, PyTorch, Numpy
Experience with working on computer vision or NLP problems
Ability to write clean, reliable code that can be easily maintained
Ability to solve problems and identify areas of improvement
Along with Python, we use flask to build APIs, docker to containerize them, rancher to deploy and orchestrate, AWS to host, CircleCI to test (and obviously Github in between all this). So experience with this stack is a plus, but not a necessity. These things are easy to learn.

Machine Learning Engineer,23 days ago,Triplebyte,,"Role Description
Triplebyte screens and evaluates thousands of engineers per month to find the best candidates for our partner companies. Human decision making doesn't work at our scale; our marketplace is powered by automated assessment and decision making. Triplebyte has three cornerstone ML products: our quiz, our interview, and our matchmaking. As a machine learning engineer, you'll be responsible for the end-to-end process of designing and running experiments to serving production models at scale. Some of our pipelines use off the shelf components, but we're also implementing custom models and techniques from the latest research papers. We're also building forecasting tools for internal teams to measure and predict outcomes. This is an ideal role for an engineer or data scientist who wants the scope and responsibility to own features/products from the inception and research phase through to measuring real-world results.
Fields your work will touch on
Psychometrics
Recommender systems
Time series analysis
Survival analysis
Bayesian inference
Probabilistic programming
Requirements
Robust exploratory/experimental skills. We have a novel dataset of candidate profiles and interview outcomes from our candidate screening process and our hiring marketplace. You'll be responsible for designing and evaluating experiments to predict downstream outcomes.
Ability to implement models from research. Some of our best improvements in both speed and predictiveness has come from doing literature surveys and implementing novel techniques from research papers.
Engineering skills. This is a hybrid research/engineering role. You'll be responsible for productionizing your pipelines/models and integrating against our back-end services.
About Triplebyte
Triplebyte is a hiring marketplace used by companies like Apple, Dropbox, Stripe, and Instacart to hire the best technical talent. We are on a mission to build a meritocratic hiring process, and we do all our evaluation background blind. Our ultimate goal is to collect the largest dataset and use this to build the world's best technical hiring process. No other company has successfully done what we're doing in this field.
We are growing extremely quickly, working on a problem that is fundamental, sitting at the crossroads between the workforce and employers. Ten years from now, it'll look silly to use anything other than Triplebyte for technical hiring.
Company Culture
We have a laid-back, friendly office culture. Over lunch you'll often find us discussing the latest in technology, books, and pop culture, and then maybe getting in a quick game of chess or babyfoot (foosball).
Since we're an early-stage company, we move fast, and it's important that each member of our team is able to take ownership of projects by defining problems, brainstorming solutions, and running experiments.

Senior Data Engineer,30+ days ago,JetFuel,"San Francisco, CA","Covid-19 Update: Business is booming and we are still growing! In an effort to help flatten the curve, we are doing interviews and onboarding all new employees remotely until further notice. The entire team, including new hires, will resume working out of the San Francisco office once it is deemed safe to do so.

Stay Healthy and Stay Safe!

Are you looking to join a dynamic startup environment with hyper-growth? If so we're looking to talk with you. We have big dreams for our product team, and we’re looking for someone extraordinary.

Who are you?

You find meaning in the abstract.
You have a strong understanding of statistics and analysis, and use these to answer core questions. You’re comfortable working with ambiguity, and high-level directions. You ask the right questions.

You can build anything.
Don’t have the right data? Data not in the right format? No problem. You can build your own pipeline, and get the information you need.

People ask you questions.
In every data team, there’s always someone that everyone else goes to with questions. You’re this person. You take pride in your deep understanding and are happy to help others.

You move fast.
You’ve never understood why other data analysts take so long to get answers. You feel that done is better than perfect and that it’s best to move quickly and iterate.

You value product, not just data.
You care about data analysis, but you also understand none of it matters if the product flops. You’ve gotten frustrated with team members who get too caught up in the details and lose sight of the bigger vision.

You’re here to make something great.
You want to change the world, and you understand that the best work doesn’t always happen between 9am-5pm. You’re willing to put in the hours to make something meaningful.

Unfortunately…
We will *not* be a good fit if:
You enjoy the structure and consistency of bigger companies. Politics and drama entertain you. You wouldn’t know how to build a new data pipeline from scratch. You aren’t comfortable with ambiguity and rapidly changing priorities. You’d rather work alone.

The details:
If you’re still reading… here’s the deal. We’re building out a world-class product team, hiring one person in each major discipline (mobile, web, server, design & data). You’ll be working closely with our existing product team which includes the creator of Boomerang, and the first designer from Oculus. You’ll be iterating on our current products but also building new products from scratch.

If all this sounds interesting to you, let’s talk!
Full-time hire benefits include:

Paid lunches on workdays, unlimited snacks, Soylent, and Nespresso
Top notch health, vision & dental plans

Anyscale provides an application development platform for developers to build distributed applications. We’re commercializing a popular open source project called Ray, which is a framework for distributed computing as well as an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning. Our goal is to build a standardized platform for distributed computing. Ray was developed at UC Berkeley by Robert Nishihara and Philipp Moritz, under the guidance of Ion Stoica and Michael Jordan, and the four of them have co-founded Anyscale. The company raised a $20.6M Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) with participation from NEA, Intel Capital, Ant Financial, Amplify Partners, 11.2 Capital, and The House Fund.

With Ray, we're making it easy to program at any scale (from your laptop to the datacenter) by providing easy-to-use, general-purpose, and high-performance tools. In addition, we are building a rich ecosystem of libraries (for reinforcement learning, hyperparameter search, experiment management, machine learning training, prediction serving, and more) on top of the core distributed system so that users can rapidly build sophisticated applications. Help us build the future of software development.

We are looking for passionate, motivated people who are excited to build tools to power the next generation of cloud applications.

We are hiring strong software engineers for a variety of roles. Examples include:

About the role:
Scalable machine learning libraries. One of the things that makes Python great is the fact that it has great libraries. Developers can import numpy and pandas and start building powerful applications. But in the distributed setting today, we don’t have libraries. Instead, we have distributed systems like Spark, Horovod, and TensorFlow Serving. These systems cannot easily be composed together and used as elements of a larger application. For example, an online learning system that ingests streaming data, incrementally trains new recommendation models, and then serves recommendations to users will have to stitch together three different distributed systems (one for streaming, one for training, and one for serving) just to build a single application. In the future, people will build these kinds of applications by importing powerful distributed libraries from a rich ecosystem and by composing them together to build new applications. Help us build that ecosystem. This will include libraries for reinforcement learning, hyperparameter tuning, experiment management, model serving, distributed training, and more. Part of this work will be open source as part of Ray.

We are looking for senior hires as well as less experienced but motivated individuals.
As part of your role you will
Develop high quality software to empower software developers and simplify programming
Work with a team of leading distributed systems and machine learning experts
Communicate your work to a broader audience through talks, tutorials, and blog posts
Help us to build and shape a world class company

Chair of Responsible Data Science,30+ days ago,The Rector & Visitors of the University of Virgini...,"Charlottesville, VA","The University of Virginia (UVA) School of Data Science (SDS)has an exciting opportunity for a tenured associate or full professor or an academic general faculty professor, on the practice track, who will also serve as the inaugural Quantitative Foundation Endowed Chair of Responsible Data Science. This is a pivotal position in the development of the School, which was founded with support from the Quantitative Foundation, the largest gift in the university’s 200 year history. A start date is negotiable until August 2021.
As we move to a data-centric society, SDS seeks to distinguish itself through the definition and practice of responsible data science. Such an outcome requires close cooperation between STEM, social science, humanities, policy and law, leading to the iterative development of a culture of responsibility around data and computation. This helps to create a culture that promotes societal benefit and works to educate all stakeholders as to the nefarious as well as unintentional possibilities of the use of data science methods and techniques. The strengths of the UVA in developing global thinkers, trained to be socially responsible leaders makes it an ideal place for responsible data science and a new form of higher education exemplified by the School of Data Science - a “School without Walls.”
The Chair of Responsible Data Science will assume directorship for the fledgling, yet resourced, Center for Data Ethics and Justice within the School. The School does not have departments but rather centers that can be nimble in a rapidly changing field. Responsibilities include maintaining an internationally recognized research program, recruiting faculty and students to build out the program, contributing to the educational mission of the School as we expand an existing Masters in Data Science as well as develop PhD and undergraduate programs. As Center Director, the Chair of Responsible Data Science will become part of the leadership team of the School and play a vital role in shaping its future. The Director position carries with it a 5-year renewable endowed appointment. Depending on the background and interests of the individual, joint or courtesy appointments with other Schools, for example, Law, Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, or the College of Arts and Sciences will be encouraged.
In summary, this important pioneering and possibly non-traditional hire represents a unique opportunity to shape a School committed to pushing the envelope in higher education in a field of unprecedented growth and opportunity where the meaning of responsible data science, while recognized of great import, is yet to be fully defined. The expectation is that the successful candidate will not only be a leader in the field of responsible data science, but also help shape what that means.
Requirements:
Recognizing that the field of data science is in its formative stage, we are interested in applications from a variety of individuals from academia, government, the private sector and non-profits who are considered influential thought leaders at the interface of STEM and humanities. Desirable prerequisites include:
National and international recognition in related research and/or application, including a public-facing track record of achievement
A demonstrated commitment to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion
A demonstrated successful experience, or strong promise, in implementing programs, policies and procedures around academic research and education at all levels
A proven ability, or strong promise, to help envision and build an organization
An ability to effectively manage direct reports and lead in a highly team-oriented and interdisciplinary environment
Highly effective verbal and written skills; ability to engage in collaborative communication, facilitate discussions and bring groups to consensus
Expertise in and ability to develop clear written policies, procedures and directions
A commitment to the development of student (undergraduate, graduate and life-long learners) focused services and/or programming
To be considered for the tenured full Professor (or Associate/full Professor) appointment, candidates must:
A terminal degree (e.g., PhD, JD, MD) in an appropriate STEM, social science or humanities field is required to be considered for a tenured appointment at the rank of Associate/Professor
To be considered for the academic general faculty Professor (Practice track), candidates must:
Equivalent experience is required to be considered for academic general faculty (AGF) on the practice track, at the rank of Professor

The Scientific Working Environment team is responsible for curating, designing, building, and supporting the day-to-day operating environment for our data scientists. We figure out what is needed and then carefully create tools and services and the best practices for using them. We believe that everything a scientist uses should be expertly crafted, with each feature having a deliberate purpose. This role is for an engineer who is excited about understanding scientists' needs and can translate these needs into a vision of what should be built. This engineer should enjoy being ""full stack"" in the sense that they own a product from beginning to end by designing, constructing, integrating, testing, documenting, and supporting their creations.
We are currently starting the design of a ""next generation"" working environment, in which we are re-thinking and ""re-platforming"" most of our tools and services. We are looking for folks to help us form the vision and build this new world.

Freelance Data Scientist for an Award-Winning Music Software...,30+ days ago,Mixed In Key,"Miami, FL","NOTE: We've recently hired 2 people for this position. While we're still accepting applications, we are looking for people with significant experience with TensorFlow and deep learning, especially if you've done audio processing and audio signal analysis using TensorFlow 2.0. If this applies to you, please let us know.

We are an award-winning software company that creates tools for musicians and DJs. As part of our Data Science work, we analyze millions of MP3/WAV music files and extract their musical DNA. We've been in business for 14 years and have helped many musicians perform better.
We are currently looking for a Data Scientist to come join our team. This work will be 100% remote. We're looking for expert knowledge and hands-on past experience with Machine Learning, TensorFlow, Keras, Image Classification, SVMs, etc.
To get started with hiring you, we're putting together a small project. After the first project is finished, we're happy to continue working with you anywhere from 1 day per week, to 5 days per week while we have enough work to give you. Currently, we have 5+ data science projects waiting to be done, so this could become a permanent remote gig, working as a 1099 consultant.

Our first project, codenamed ""Similarity"" could be described as:
1. Examine the ""Meta-Data"" dataset with 3000 rows and 380 columns containing Floating-point values, for example: ""ABC"": 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.9990, ....
2. Look at the ""Training"" dataset where human trainers wrote that the combination of Row #2 from the ""Meta-Data"" dataset and the Row #2950 from the ""Meta-Data"" dataset have a lot in common, and human-labelled the combination a ""5"" on a 1 to 5 similarity scale. This is the value we're trying to predict. The size of the training data is small (low thousands), but can be increased if needed.
3. Use the Training dataset to train your own model that predicts the value on a scale of 1 to 5
4. Create a tool that can take any 2 random rows from the original Meta-Data dataset and predict their value when combined together
5. Run a simulation of performing the prediction 100,000 times and generate a histogram showing the distribution of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 values. Show us how long it took you to run the 100,000 prediction simulation.
The challenge is that we don't know which of the 380 columns in the original ""Meta-Data"" yield the best results for similarity training. So your job is to figure out how to reduce that parameter set to a smaller number and train your model efficiently.
If this is the type of data science you're interested in and can provide results that would place in the Top 5% on Kaggle, please contact us. Thanks! Other jobs in our pipeline are similar to this one. We're happy to hire right away.",,

Data Engineer,30+ days ago,B12,"New York, NY 10003 (Flatiron District area)","Data Engineering at B12
B12's engineering team views software as a craft, but improving the world as the reason to practice it. Our engineers are responsible for prioritizing, conceptualizing, co-designing, building, testing, and engaging users for any concept we are building out. We're generalists in encouraging each other to experience the full stack, but we're also aware of each other's preferences in the stack. We mentor and teach where we can, both inside and outside of the company.
We value sharing our work with the outside world. Our team has published papers on forming expert flash teams and machine-mediated worker hierarchies. We've baked our research into Orchestra, the system that coordinates our expert and machine teams, and released Orchestra into open source to contribute our software back to the community.
We're looking for a Data Engineer to help us answer critical questions our business faces while improving our data systems and architecture to support greater variety, volume, and velocity of data and data sources. We hope our engineers have more longevity than any one tool we use, but here is a sampling of our current thoughts about technology:
We build our product on Python/Django and JavaScript/React.
We store blobs in Amazon's S3, munch on them in Amazon's EC2, develop in Docker, and deploy containers to Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk.
We believe Postgres should be the first system you consider when you think about persisting structured data.
We religiously clean and centralize data in Amazon's Redshift, and are able to answer most any question in SQL. We recently wrote our 1000th query in Metabase!
Before building complex statistical machine learning models, we build simple ones we can understand. Rarely, we build complex models.
We have near-full test coverage on the backend, and are making progress on our frontend and integration tests.
We set up continuous integration and deployment because, while this model comes with its own pains, we've disliked being on fixed release schedules on previous projects.
We like to move fast and support point-in-time recovery :).
As a Data Engineer, you will
Collaborate with operational teams including sales, marketing, and customer success.
Contribute to infrastructure that enables and informs B12's analytical efforts.
Write SQL queries and reusable views that enable various analyses including funnel, retention, and performance reporting.
Use Python to clean data, send it to various systems including our data warehouse and operational services, and perform feature engineering to power the creation of predictive models.
Build rules-based models and statistical machine learning models in Python using packages like scikit-learn.
You'd be a good fit if
You are fluent in SQL and Python.
You have experience building and using data infrastructure, including systems like Postgres and Redshift.
You've used reporting tools like Metabase, Tableau, or Looker in the past.
You know that no dataset is ever pristine, but love to interrogate, structure, and clean data.
You've contributed to extract-transform-load pipelines to collect data from disparate sources and centralize them in a data warehouse.
You feel comfortable managing your time and deciding amongst competing priorities.
You have worked with non-engineering teams and are comfortable explaining technical solutions to them.
You are passionate about the future of work.
You enjoy learning and teaching.
You have strong written and verbal communication skills in English.
You care about and want to contribute to our mission of helping people do meaningful work.
Don't fear
We don't have a minimum number of years of experience for this role. We highly favor talent and interest.
Some candidates may see this list and feel discouraged because they don't match all the items. Please apply anyway: there's a good chance you're more wonderful than you think you are.
B12 is a safe place for human beings. We are dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive team with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences, each helping us understand our customers better, and strengthen our team. We particularly encourage you to apply if you identify as a woman, are a person of color or other underrepresented minority, or are a member of the LGBTQIA community.
How to apply
